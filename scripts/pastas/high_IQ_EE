To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Electronic Materials. The subject is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the derivations will go over a typical studentâ€™s head. Thereâ€™s also the MOSFETâ€™s intrinsic conduction, which is deftly woven into its operational regions- itâ€™s development draws heavily from quantum mechanics, for instance. The postgrads understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these equations, to realise that theyâ€™re not just useful- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Electronic Materials truly AREidiots- of course they wouldnâ€™t appreciate, for instance, the curve of the graphs in the ever marvellous Zener Diodeâ€™s reverse breakdown, which itself is a complex integration from the junction capacitance study. Iâ€™m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Gordon Mooreâ€™s genius wit unfolds itself on the lecture slides. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Professor M. Missous tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. Itâ€™s for the ladiesâ€™ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that theyâ€™re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ðŸ˜Ž
