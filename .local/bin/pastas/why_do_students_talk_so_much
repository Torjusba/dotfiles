This is an academic school, not a social school. My classes are full of chatter, most students are walking around in groups chatting, half the dining hall sits in groups, etc. Chatting and "friendship" is pointless, they should study instead...

You don't need friends to make A's. Case in point, I have no friends and make A's. "Social life" is a waste of time. All the lonely kids here who complain about trouble making friends are being spoiled brats who think having friends is a necessity, and they should be happy with just making good grades. Socializing is not a necessity, unlike food and water.

Unlike you lesser apes. I have evolved beyond primitive desires for companionship. I am a completely rational, asexual human being an intellectual.
